# Line-Follower
Line Follower robot utilizing PID control algorithms (Demo Version).\
The hardware used: Arduino Mega, QTR-8RC reflectance sensor array, TB6612FNG H-bridge, dc motors.\
The robot reads a black line on the floor and through the PID process it stays on track.\
To be added: Wireless PID tuning with bluetooth (with custom app) or Infrared light sensor, automatic calibration system on startup, start and emergency stop buttons (idealy with custom app), gyroscope mechanism for roller coaster loop traversal, any sort of ultrasonic sensor for wall detection.
